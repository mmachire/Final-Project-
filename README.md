# Final-Project-

Abstract: 

	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a multipotent stem cell found in various organs around the body but are most prevalent in the bone marrow. MSCs differentiate into a variety of cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes. The specific location of the MSC has a large effect on the differentiation of the cell – for example, MSCs found in bone marrow are much more likely to differentiate into osteoblasts than other cell types. This project will look at the differences in gene expression between MSCs found in different places around the body to see whether differences in these cells can be observed before differentiation even begins.  
Plan: 
We have RNA-Seq data for MSCs from different parts of the body. We will use Nonnegative matrix factorization to determine metagenes (or patterns of gene expression) and this will then give us certain genes that are important/different patterns of gene expression for the different locations of cells. Then we will look for structural variants that occur around these genes of interest. 
What I will need to do: 
Learn how to implement NMF – Julia has a package of NMF
Get Structural Variants from USCS Genome Browser or another genome database 
Locate Structural Variants around the genome
